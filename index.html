<h1>What is Python?</h1>
<img src="python.png" style="height:200px;width: 500px;">
<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.</p>
<h1>History of Python</h1>
<p>Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
In February 1991, Guido Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage collection systems.
On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.
ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System.
The following programming languages influence Python:
ABC language.
Modula-3</p>
<h1>Features of Python</h1>
<h2>Easy to Learn and Use</h2>
<p>Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.</p>
<h2>Interpreted Language</h2>
<p>Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.</p>
<h2>Free and Open Source</h2>
<p>Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org
. It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards make new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny."</p>
<h2>Object-Oriented Language</h2>
<p>Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.</p>
<h1>What is MySQL?</h1>
<img src="mysql.png" style="height:200px;width: 500px;">
<p>MySQL is the world’s most popular open source database. According to DB-Engines, MySQL ranks as the second-most-popular database, behind Oracle Database. MySQL powers many of the most accessed applications, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Shopify, and Booking.com.

Since MySQL is open source, it includes numerous features developed in close cooperation with users over more than 25 years. So it’s very likely that your favorite application or programming language is supported by MySQL Database</p>
<h1>History of MySQL</h1>
<p>The SQL programming language was developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The programming language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following Edgar Frank Codd’s paper, “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,” in 1970.

In his paper, Codd proposed that all data in a database be represented in relations. Based on this theory, Boyce and Chamberlin came up with SQL. In Oracle Quick Guides (Cornelio Books, 2013), author Malcolm Coxall writes that the original version of SQL was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM’s original relational database management system, System R.

It wasn’t until several years later, however, that the SQL language was made publicly available. In 1979, a company called Relational Software, which later became Oracle, commercially released its own version of SQL, called Oracle V2.

Since then, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization have deemed SQL the standard language in relational database communication. While major SQL vendors modify the language to their desires, most base their SQL programs on the ANSI-approved version.</p>
<h1>Features of MySQL</h1>
<h2>Open-Source</h2>
<p>MySQL is open-source, which means this software can be downloaded, used and modified by anyone. It is free-to-use and easy-to-understand. The source code of MySQL can be studied, and changed based on the requirements.  It uses GPL, i.e. GNU General Public license which defines rules and regulations regarding what can and can’t be done using the application</p>
<h2>Quick and Reliable</h2>
<p>MySQL stores data efficiently in the memory ensuring that data is consistent, and not redundant. Hence, data access and manipulation using MySQL is quick.</p>
<h2>Scalable</h2>
<p>Scalability refers to the ability of systems to work easily with small amounts of data, large amounts of data, clusters of machines, and so on. MySQL server was developed to work with large databases. </p>
<h1>Python VS MySQL</h1>
<p>The key difference between SQL and Python is that developers use SQL to access and extract data from a database, whereas developers use Python to analyze and manipulate data by running regression tests, time series tests and other data processing computations. SQL's greatest advantage is its ability to combine data from multiple tables within a single database.

SQL is simpler and has a narrower range of functions compared to Python. Queries that SQL produces depend on functions, which are codes that perform specific tasks. However, SQL functions have fewer applications than Python. Instead of using functions, Python uses programming libraries, which can apply to a broad range of development projects. These programming libraries contain specific pieces and instructions for developing particular software or applications. For example, some Python libraries include:

Pandas for data analysis
PyPDF2 for manipulating PDFs
SciPy for numerical routines
NumPy for mathematical operations and scientific computing
Scikit-learn for machine learning</p>
